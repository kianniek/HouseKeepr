# HouseKeepr

HouseKeepr is an all-in-one household agenda and task manager designed to simplify daily home life. It helps track chores, schedule reminders, and coordinate tasks among family members or roommates.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a desktop-based dashboard that runs on Electron and React. The application will eventually display calendar events, track household chores, provide weather updates, and show quick reminders so that everyone in the home stays organized.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the app: `npm start`

## Project Structure

- `electron/` - Electron main process code
- `src/` - React frontend source code
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files to ignore in git
- `package.json` - Project metadata and dependencies

## Project Planning

The development will be completed in small phases:

1. **Phase 1** – Boilerplate setup of Electron and React (current phase).
2. **Phase 2** – Integrate calendar events, weather data, and news headlines.
3. **Phase 3** – Add configuration options, polish the UI, and prepare for deployment on Raspberry Pi.

Each phase builds on the previous one so the project remains functional throughout development.
