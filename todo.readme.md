## HouseKeepr — Project TODO (chronological)

This file was generated by an automated codebase scan. It lists the current status and a chronological checklist of next steps to get the project to a reproducible, CI-backed, and release-ready state.

- [x] 1) Project scaffold & codebase present
  - Flutter app at `housekeepr/` with platform folders (android, ios, linux, macos, windows, web).
  - App code in `housekeepr/lib/` (UI pages, cubits, repositories, services).
  - Tests exist under `housekeepr/test/` (unit and widget tests).

- [x] 2) Local persistence and models implemented
  - `Task`, `SubTask`, `ShoppingItem`, repositories (SharedPreferences-based) exist.
  - `WriteQueue` and `HistoryRepository` implemented.

- [x] 3) Firebase integration wiring present (partial)
  - `firebase_options.dart` exists (generated), app initializes `Firebase.initializeApp()` in `lib/main.dart`.
  - Firestore remote repos and sync service are present.
  - NOTE: Values are provided via build-time defines / env vars — developer must supply them.

- [ ] 4) Developer setup: provide local Firebase config & environment variables
  - [ ] Run `flutterfire configure` or set the required `--dart-define` keys / PowerShell env vars before running the app.
  - Required keys (examples in `housekeepr/README.md`): FIREBASE_* per platform (WEB/ANDROID/IOS/WINDOWS/etc.).

- [ ] 5) Tests & static analysis on local environment
  - [ ] Run `flutter test --reporter expanded` and fix any failing tests in the current environment.
  - [ ] Run `flutter analyze` and address analyzer warnings & lints (follow `effective_dart`).
  - Edge-case checks: tests that require emulator or emulator-host (Firestore emulator) may be skipped unless env vars are set.

- [ ] 6) CI: add GitHub Actions to validate PRs (test + analyze + build)
  - [ ] Test matrix for stable Flutter version (3.13+) to run unit and widget tests.
  - [ ] Lint/format check and `flutter analyze`.
  - [ ] Optional: web build step (uses --dart-define via secrets).

- [ ] 7) CI: configure secrets for Firebase build-time defines
  - [ ] Add repository secrets for the FIREBASE_* keys used by `firebase_options.dart` when building web/mobile in CI.
  - [ ] Update GH workflow to pass `--dart-define` values.

- [ ] 8) Integration / emulator tests & docs
  - [ ] Provide a small script / docs to run Firestore emulator locally for integration tests (some tests already check FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST env var).
  - [ ] Add instructions in README for running emulator + integration test commands on Windows (PowerShell snippets already present; confirm and update).

- [ ] 9) Fix outstanding small issues & polish
  - [ ] Check assets referenced in code (e.g. `assets/flutterfire_logo.png` referenced in `auth_gate.dart`). Ensure assets listed in `pubspec.yaml` and included.
  - [ ] Search for any `// TODO` comments and triage into issues.
  - [ ] Verify `firebase_options.dart` platform coverage (linux currently throws UnsupportedError in generated file; if linux target is desired, re-run FlutterFire CLI and configure linux options if supported).

- [ ] 10) Release & packaging
  - [ ] Raspberry Pi: finalize `flutter build linux --release` packaging instructions, systemd unit, and image installation docs.
  - [ ] Mobile: document signing steps for Android (AAB/APKs) and iOS builds.
  - [ ] Desktop: prepare installers for Windows (.exe/.msi) and macOS (dmg/pkg) as needed.

- [ ] 11) Documentation & contribution improvements
  - [ ] Update `README.md` to include quick-start with pre-filled steps for local dev (exact flutter version, `flutter pub get`, env var examples).
  - [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING guide and PR template; add issue templates for feature/bug/security.

- [ ] 12) Open-source readiness
  - [ ] Verify license file (`LICENSE`) present and correct (MIT expected).
  - [ ] Add badges in the top-level README for CI status and pub package versions (if publishing packages).

Notes from the scan (high level):
- The app structure and features (Tasks, Shopping, Households, Profiles) are implemented in `housekeepr/lib` with state management via `flutter_bloc` (cubits).
- Local repos using `SharedPreferences` exist; remote Firestore repositories and sync service are present to connect local state to Firestore.
- Tests are included and appear to cover model roundtrips, repositories, and some widgets. Some integration tests check for emulator env vars and will skip if not present.
- Firebase values rely on build-time defines or environment variables; CI will need secrets if you want automated builds.

Next recommended short workflow (chronological):
1. Provide Firebase env vars locally and verify app boots (`flutter run`).
2. Run `flutter test` and `flutter analyze` and resolve issues found.
3. Add CI workflow to run tests and lint on PRs (use secrets for web builds).
4. Triage `TODO` items and missing assets, fix and document.
5. Complete release packaging and documentation.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Run the test suite locally in this workspace and report failures.
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `flutter test` and `flutter analyze` on PRs and main.
- Search the codebase for `TODO` comments and collect them into issues.

Which of these would you like me to do next? (I can start by running tests.)
